# 🚗 Car Price Prediction and Classification - Internship Task (Week 02)

This project is submitted as part of the **Week 02 Internship Task** at **Sapience EDU Connect Pvt. Ltd.**

It demonstrates the complete end-to-end process of building and evaluating machine learning models to:
- Predict used car prices (regression)
- Classify cars as **High Price** or **Low Price** (classification)
